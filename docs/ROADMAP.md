# RVC2MQTT Product Roadmap

## Vision
Make RV systems as smart and accessible as smart homes - enabling any RV owner to monitor and control their RV through Home Assistant with zero configuration.

## Guiding Principles
1. **User Experience First** - Zero-config should be the default
2. **Backwards Compatible** - Don't break existing deployments
3. **Open Standards** - MQTT, Home Assistant, ESPHome
4. **Community Driven** - Open source, documented, extensible
5. **Security Conscious** - Validate inputs, audit commands, secure by default

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **RV-C spec changes** - Monitor RVIA updates, maintain flexibility
- **HA breaking changes** - Follow HA dev closely, test beta releases
- **Hardware reliability** - Extensive testing, quality components
- **CAN bus interference** - Proper electrical isolation, filtering

### Business Risks
- **Market size** - Start open-source, validate before commercialization
- **Competition** - Focus on UX and ease-of-use differentiator
- **Support burden** - Build strong documentation, community support
- **Regulatory** - Ensure compliance before commercial launch

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Keep core open-source to ensure community longevity
2. Modular design allows pivoting between architectures
3. Start with Python to validate before ESP32 investment
4. Build community before building product
5. Partner with established RV tech companies
